Explanation behind the code: 

Contact: Holds PhoneNumber, Name, it uses a constructor that assigns values to the properties. 

ContackBook: Holds a List that holds multiple Contact objects, it also has two methods "AddContact" and "DisplayContact"

Program: Uses different things like try-catch to handle errors if user enters letters instead of numbers. In the Main() method it has an instance of ContactBook and uses while loop so the menu stays visible until the user decides to exit.


How to use: 
Press 1 to add a contact 
            
Press 2 to view contacts

Press 0 to exit
